BattleShipGame whith PlayTools

It's a Battleship game. I had the idea of statistics section tool to decrese the guesses needed for finisihing the game. It is done counting all the posibilities of the ships and then suming the changes for a single space in the map. The code is done with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
